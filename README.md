**Overview**

This is a very ugly barebones "clone" of Bandcamp.

You can:

- Create and log in as different **user** accounts.

- Create, view, and delete **albums** and **reviews** based on your permissions.

- Create, view, and delete **collections** of albums.


I have also had limited success with adding **multer** (for uploading audio tracks and local images), as well as using **Angular** (in order to create a layout more similar to the actual Bandcamp website). However, I am still running into issues with integrating those technologies. As such, right now the pushed code above is the **most functional iteration** of the project.
